Exercise 5.6:
Give the figure corresponding to Figure 5.2 for the result of running Euclid's
algorithm for the inputs 89 and 55.

gcd(89, 55)
  gcd(55, 34)
    gcd(34, 21)
      gcd(21, 13)
        gcd(13, 8)
          gcd(8, 5)
            gcd(5, 3)
              gcd(3, 2)
                gcd(2, 1)
                  gcd(1, 0)
