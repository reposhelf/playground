Question 1:
How many external nodes are there in an M-ary tree with N internal nodes?

Answer 1:
M - arity;
N - count of internal nodes;
X - ? (count of external nodes);

1st, find count of all links in a tree:
    N * M

2nd, subtract from the number from previous step count of internal nodes, but excluding root:
    N * M - (N - 1)

So,
    X = N * M - (N - 1)

Question 2:
Use your answer to give the amount of memory required to represent such a tree,
assuming that links and items require one word of memory each.

Answer 2:
Suppose that I have a 4-ary tree with 12 internal nodes and word on my architecture
has 8 byte.
Count of links is M * N = 48.
Count of all nodes is (M * N + 1) = 49.
Memory to be used is 48 + 49 = 97 words or 776 bytes.
