Qt version:       5.9
OpenSSL version:  1.0


Server Side:
Server may be run from command line by set port and directory for files saving, for example:
    
    server 3000 /home/user_name
    
Server fetch SSL certificate and key from Qt's resource files localhost.key and localhost.pem,
which generated by openssl. During generating, "Common Name" parameter was set to 127.0.0.1, because of that, you can run application correctly on 127.0.0.1 host only. This also applies to the client side. Generate and insert to the project new SSL certificate and key for use other hosts.


Client Side:
To less typing host and port, I include JSON file with default host and port, called server_data.json, to the project resources. Edit it to use other host and port.
